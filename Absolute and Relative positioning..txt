1. Absolute Positioning
Definition: When an element is set to position: absolute;, it is removed from the normal document flow and positioned relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (an ancestor element with position: relative, absolute, or fixed). If no such ancestor exists, it is positioned relative to the <html> element (the document itself).
Behavior:
The element does not affect the position of sibling elements.
Its placement is determined by the values of top, right, bottom, and left properties.
It allows precise placement of the element anywhere on the page or within a container.

2. Relative Positioning
Definition: When an element is set to position: relative;, it remains in the normal document flow, but it can be offset relative to its original position using top, right, bottom, and left.
Behavior:
The space for the element is still reserved in the layout as if it were not offset.
Sibling elements are not affected by its offset.
Itâ€™s often used to position an element slightly or as a container for absolutely positioned child elements.
